FFPE branch introduced name change, with tindaisy2.cwl renamed as tindaisy2.6.1.cwl
This results in no output changes, but added bypass_classification parameter.
Also is derived from tindaisy2.6.1-ffpe.cwl

v2.6.2
* VLD Filter updated.  Correction to VCF header, does not affect results
* VEP annotation image updated, using VEP v99 like before
