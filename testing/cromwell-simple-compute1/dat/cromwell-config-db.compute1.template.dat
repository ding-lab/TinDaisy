#
# Important : Prior to running, be sure to create a WORKFLOW_ROOT directory and replace all instances
# of the string WORKFLOW_ROOT below with the appropriate value.  For instance,
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT="/scratch1/fs1/dinglab/m.wyczalkowski/cromwell-data"
# Rename the resulting file to cromwell-config-db.compute1.dat

# location to write error output logs from individual tools:
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/logs/cromwell-%J.err
# location for Cromwell's main working directory (temp, intermediate, and final files will all be stored here)
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/cromwell-executions
# location to write Cromwell's workflow logs
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/cromwell-workflow-logs



# Selecting same filesystem as where BAMs are stored allows for hard links and is much faster.
