Do: use /gscmnt/gc2508/dinglab/mwyczalk/cromwell as base dir for all cromwell output

However, we get the following warning:
    [2018-10-03 15:21:07,89] [warn] Localization via hard link has failed: /gscmnt/gc2508/dinglab/mwyczalk/cromwell/cromwell-executions/tindaisy.cwl/5fc4b6a6-e1f8-43f6-8456-8d8fd48f9f81/call-run_pindel/inputs/-1359319482/CPT0088630009.WholeExome.RP-1303.bam -> /gscmnt/gc2741/ding/CPTAC3-data/GDC_import/data/e8e6b393-a65b-43c9-982b-7910b5b55eac/CPT0088630009.WholeExome.RP-1303.bam: Invalid cross-device link

This suggests that having the output directory be on the same partition as the BAMs (thus permitting hard link) would make things much faster, since a lot of initial time is spent copying the BAMs over
