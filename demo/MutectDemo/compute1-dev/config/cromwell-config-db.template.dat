# location to write error output logs from individual tools:
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/logs/cromwell-%J.err
# location for Cromwell's main working directory (temp, intermediate, and final files will all be stored here)
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/cromwell-executions
# location to write Cromwell's workflow logs
#   WORKFLOW_ROOT/cromwell-workflow-logs

# Selecting same filesystem as where BAMs are stored allows for hard links and is much faster.
