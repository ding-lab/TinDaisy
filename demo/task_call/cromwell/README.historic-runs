Initial GBM runs circa 4/14-4/17 for development.  These were stopped even though a number
succeeded because the wrong dbSnP-COSMIC database was used (20190416 is the corrected one).
The runs were distributed among a number of running directories, as described below.

These runs will be used for testing of cleanup before they are discarded entirely.
