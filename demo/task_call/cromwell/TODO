Step 4 should be cleaning of output directory per workflow ID.  There are several levels associated with this.
1. delete all staged data (inputs directory)
2. Delete staged and compress all step intermediate data
3. Delete all staged and step intermediate data
4. Delete all staged data, step intermediate data, and step final data (leave only final step as is)
5. Remove entire output directory

Cromwell output directory will be obtained from querying database
