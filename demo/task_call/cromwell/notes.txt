To obtain Workflow ID from log of CASE,
    WID=$(grep "SingleWorkflowRunnerActor: Workflow submitted" logs/$CASE.out | sed 's/\x1b\[[0-9;]*m//g' | sed -n -e 's/^.*submitted //p')

To get status of a workflow,
    url -X GET "https://genome-cromwell.gsc.wustl.edu/api/workflows/v1/$WD/status" -H "accept: application/json"


Current runs started 13:00 4/13/19, mutect died early on these but they continue on.  Running using parallel.  How to kill?
C3L-00365 : 076b9ae7-aa74-4fc0-aa0e-91bfa849795e 
C3L-00674 : 835026a1-9f36-4c05-96fb-092e73174afb
C3L-00677 : 9ce8cead-6592-471b-827b-3d280f3d4f0e

`ps -eaf | grep parallel` does list PIDs of running parallel proceses, and sending kill signal results in response in 
log.  Did this for 2/3 processes.  However, it is not clear that the running jobs (run_pindel, for instance) get this
signal
C3L-00365 : 076b9ae7-aa74-4fc0-aa0e-91bfa849795e  -> killed
C3L-00674 : 835026a1-9f36-4c05-96fb-092e73174afb  -> killed
C3L-00677 : 9ce8cead-6592-471b-827b-3d280f3d4f0e  -> this was later killed as well in the same way

First two both have the following as last line in log.out:
[2019-04-13 18:12:21,54] [warn] DispatchedConfigAsyncJobExecutionActor [076b9ae7run_strelka2:NA:1]: DispatchedConfigAsyncJobExecutionActor [076b9ae7:run_strelka2:NA:1] Failed to abort StandardAsyncJob(7411737): Unable to find task kill_docker

-> looking at logs of runs from above url is helpful.  For instance, it turns out that Pindel did die; the log file

Summary and next steps:
-> I don't know how to effectively stop jobs which are started with `parallel`
-> output files of these files moved to directory named after the workflow ID
