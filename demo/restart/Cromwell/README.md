Goal is to develop simple test of running tindaisy-postcall.cwl, which 
is a workflow which starts following the vaf / length / depth filter
for each caller.

Testing is done on past TinDaisy runs (details)
Prior work on restarts done in MMRF_WXS_Restart
Cromwell testing based on work here: https://github.com/ding-lab/mnp_filter/tree/master/testing/cwl_call
