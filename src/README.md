# Log files

Rely on two log files, runlog.dat and datalog.dat
See runtidy and datatidy for details about these, respectively.
By default these are ./logs/runlog.dat and ./logs/datalog.dat
    Default values may be changed with -L or -l arguments, respectively,
    or by defining RUNLOG and DATALOG environment variables
