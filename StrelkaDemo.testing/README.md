Scripts here are used to run Somatic Wrapper directly from within docker container.
Provides a test bed using StrelkaDemo test dataset for development and testing

## Quick start
1. Start Docker container and mount volumes with `start_docker.sh`
2. Once within container, update SomaticWrapper project with
   `git pull origin cwl`
3. Install TinDaisy
   `cd /usr/local; git clone https://github.com/ding-lab/tin-daisy.git`
4. Test individual steps
```
   cd /usr/local/tin-daisy/StrelkaDemo.testing
   bash run.SomaticWrapper.docker.sh STEP
```
where STEP is 1,2,3,4,5,7,8,10.  This will write output to `./results` directory.  Compare results with `git diff`

## Docker testing and development

The Docker image `cgc-images.sbgenomics.com/m_wyczalkowski/somatic-wrapper:cwl` incorporates the CWL branch
of SomaticWrapper, and is the image used for all work here.

To start a docker container,
```
docker run -it cgc-images.sbgenomics.com/m_wyczalkowski/somatic-wrapper:cwl bash
```
To open another terminal in a running container (with container ID `03e59caeeb98`):
```
docker exec -it 03e59caeeb98 bash
```
Use `docker ps -a` and `docker start` to discover and restart stopped containers

## Editing and committing
Editing SomaticWrapper within the docker image is very helpful for development and debugging.  It requires at least
one terminal running in the container.  Once edits are made in the container, they need to be incorporated into the image.
This can be done in one of two ways:

### Docker Commit
```
docker commit 03e59caeeb98 cgc-images.sbgenomics.com/m_wyczalkowski/somatic-wrapper:cwl
```
will incorporate them into the image.  Such edits will then be available the next time the image runs.
These can be pushed to cgc-images with,  
```
docker push cgc-images.sbgenomics.com/m_wyczalkowski/somatic-wrapper:cwl
```

### Docker Build

A preferred alternative (to maintain reproducibility) is to `git push` to the
repository from within the container, then re-generate the image using
`1_docker_build.sh` and `2_push_docker.sh` in `somaticwrapper/docker`, which 
clones the github repository.
